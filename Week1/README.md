# Week 1

In this week, we will learn about Python, in particular Python Libraries such an ```NumPy```, ```TensorFlow```, ```PyTorch```, ```MatPlotLib``` and ```Scikit-Learn```.

## Assignment 1

### Part I

The notebook ```MNIST.ipynb``` present in this repository contains various from-scratch implementations of common Machine Learning Algorithms.

Your task will be to rewrite each of these using the standard implementations of these algorithms using ```Scikit-Learn```.

### Part II

This repository also contains some starter code for creating a window and moving a square around in it. Modify this code to implement a game of [Snake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>).

### Notes

- Do not worry if you don't fully understand the algorithms or their from-scratch implementations, these algorithms are mostly Supervised Learning algorithms which we will not use for RL. This assignment is purely to familiarize you with Python and the Libraries in it.
- This project is intended to be highly collaborative, so get to know your co-mentees and work with them on this!
- Learn to use ```git``` for version control while working with them
- Submission instructions will be announced soon. The assignment should be finished within a week from today (17th December)
