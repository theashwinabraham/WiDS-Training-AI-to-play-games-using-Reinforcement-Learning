'''
The first task to work with a gym env is to initialise it using gym.make(name_of_env) and reset it using .reset() function. This resets the env to a starting position, with some noise in state. It returns a tuple of the initial state of environment and a dictionary containing info (Not important for the moment).

Just as a environment in RL, you can take action based on current state. This is done using env.step(action), and it returns the following 5 values:

1. Next State: The state the environment transitioned to after taking the step.

2. Reward: Reward received for taking the action

3. Terminated: A boolean which is true if the environment terminated after taking the action. The condition for this termination is provided in the documentation of the environment.

4. Truncated: A boolean which is true if the environment was truncated after taking the action, usually because we cannot run a environment for infinite time, and hence every environment has a truncation period. More details in the documentation

Note: You must call env.reset() after either termination or truncation.

5. Info: A dictionary containing information of env.

The observation space of Mountation Car is an array of two variables: Position of car(x - coordinate) and velocity of cart. 

Three actions are possible, as mentioned in documentation

        Q-Table. We have provided one way to initialise it, and tried to keep it general, so you even try a different environment. You are adviced to think of other ways you could have initialised it.
        
        The dimensions of Q-Table must be parts of state-1 x parts of state-2 x actions (why?). It is initialised with random values here.

        Suppose low for position is 0, and high 2, and discretised it in 20 parts. Then the sections are [0-0.1], [0.1-0.2]...[1.9-2], and index for say position=0.45 will be 4 (in [0.4-0.5])
        
        The state here is a array of length self.observation_space_size(2). Other necessary variables are initialised in init method. Try to keep this function general for any environment, but you may hardcode the numbers if you feel the task is difficult to generalise.
